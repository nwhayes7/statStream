	of software and other application-related vulnerabilities.  allows attackers to monitor and eavesdrop on communications, sniff and track traffic, capture relevant
	credentials, and access and alter account and user profile characteristics (changing passwords and more).
	4. api security - 
	5. denial of service - prevent users from accessing services and resources from a specified system or location. this can be done using any number of attack vectors available but typically look to target buffers, memory, network bandwidth, or processor power.
	6. malicious insiders - disgruntled employees, contractor, or partner
	7. abusing cloud services for bad intent - eg execute dictionary attacks, dos attacks, crack encryption passwords, host illegal sw for distribution

Rancho‚àö¬¢‚Äö√á¬®‚Äö√ë¬¢s goal is to approach medicine differently by offering more cohesive care and education that extends beyond the four walls of the exam room. We do not just make suggestions and write prescriptions, we have taken steps to improve the health of our patients. Our family physicians have developed educational content that empowers their community to make healthy lifestyle changes.  We also have free senior centers for our patients 65 and older that are full of exercise and nutrition classes as well as full online courses teaching a wide variety of health topics. We pride ourselves on going beyond the exam room to make our community healthier and happier.","500-1000 employees
